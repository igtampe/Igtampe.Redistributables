# Igtampe.Redistributables.Actions
The heart of the controllers, and an evolution in the separation of concerns in the Redistributables project. This was the brunt of the Redistributables rewrite from the old commons project. 


More details will be added to this readme later, but yeah. Basically most of what's in the controllers readme is now here.
