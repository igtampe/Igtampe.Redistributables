# Igtampe Interfaces

This project includes a set of common interfaces I use on some projects. A lot of these are taken from Neco.

|Interface|Description
|-|-|
|Dateable| Any item that has a date of creation |
|Depictable| Any item with an image URL that can depict it|
|Describable| Any item with a string description field|
|Identifiable| Any item with an ID of any kind. There are two subtypes for Identifiable. These being **AutomaticallyGeneratableIdentifiable**, which is a GUID based identifiable whose ID is generated by the DB upon creation, and **ManuallyGeneratableIdentifiable**, which is an identifiable of any basic variable type (usually string) which can be generated using an ID Generator by the backend before being saved to the database|
|Nameable| Any item with a name|

## Ownership:
A few interfaces and utilities for ownership are present, including:

|Interface|Description|
|-|-|
|Ownable| An object that can be owned by another|
|MultiOwnable| An object that can be owned by a list of others|
|PrimaryOwnable| A multi-ownable object that has a primary owner |

Additionally, IsOwner() is present to check if an object is an owner of an ownable of type Ownable, MultiOwnable, or PrimaryOwnable.

## ID Generators

ID generators are small objects containing a function that can generate a random ID of any base type (Usually a string). In Neco, these include only one for the moment:
|Generator|Description|
|-|-|
|NumericalGenerator|A configurable on instantiation generator of Numerical string IDs of a certain length. (IE: Generating 5 number IDs for User accounts like 57174)|
