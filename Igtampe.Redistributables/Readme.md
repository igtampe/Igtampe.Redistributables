# Igtampe.Redistributables
The essential redistributables for all of my web based projects! Including the following libraries:

- **ChopoAuth:** A barebones authentication suite with simple password hashing provided by Hashbrown
- **ChopoImageHandling:** A little wrapper class to hold images in a database
- **ChopoSessionManager:** A tiny but mighty online session manager, meant to be used with ChopoAuth, and an IUserDbContext (See Redistributables.DBContexts)
- **Hashbrown:** Just add some salt, and you can hash any string with SHA256.
- **Interfaces and Exceptions:** The absolute most common stuff in my coding experience (So common its on the root Igtampe namespace!)
- **Notifier:** A simple class to manage notifications

And a few other tiny things!
